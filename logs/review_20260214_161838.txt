STATE: REQUEST_CHANGES
SUMMARY: This review identifies several areas for improvement. A critical issue involves highly redundant code in the bulk ticket processing, which should be removed. Additionally, the classification logic within `process_single_bulk_item` is hard to maintain and scale, and the validation loops are inefficient. There are 6 LOW severity findings related to magic numbers, code structure, debug prints, sensitive data logging, and docstring clarity.

--- FINDINGS (3) ---
ai-ticket-classifier/app/api/routes.py:20
Comment: The `process_single_bulk_item` function uses a series of `if/elif` statements with keyword checks for classification and priority. This approach is hard to maintain, scale, and test. Consider a more robust classification mechanism (e.g., a dedicated classifier model, a configuration-driven rule engine, or a more structured data-driven approach) instead of hardcoded keyword lists.
--------------------
ai-ticket-classifier/app/api/routes.py:77
Comment: Redundant validation loops: The code iterates through `results` multiple times for validation (lines 77-83) and then again to create `final_results` (lines 85-101). This is inefficient and makes the code harder to follow. Validation should be consolidated.
--------------------
ai-ticket-classifier/app/api/routes.py:103
Comment: Highly redundant code: The loop starting at line 103 (`for idx, res in enumerate(final_results):`) and the subsequent creation of `output_buffer` and `ret` (lines 103-124) simply copy the `final_results` without any modification. This is a significant code smell, impacts maintainability, and adds no value. This entire block should be removed, and `final_results` should be returned directly.
