STATE: REQUEST_CHANGES
SUMMARY: This review highlights several critical security vulnerabilities, including SQL injection, arbitrary code execution, command injection, and hardcoded secrets. Performance issues such as inefficient algorithms, N+1 query problems, and high computational complexity are also present. Additionally, there are architectural concerns regarding class responsibilities and basic input validation. 

There are 2 low severity findings: 
- Inefficient calculation in `Order.calculate_total`.
- Basic input validation in `SystemManager.validate_input`.

FINDINGS: 31
