--------------------
test-project/data_processor.py:1
Comment: Intentional `time.sleep(0.1)` within a loop significantly degrades performance. This should be removed or justified.
--------------------
test-project/data_processor.py:1

--------------------
test-project/data_processor.py:1

--------------------
test-project/data_processor.py:1
Comment: The `process_batch` function has three nested loops with O(n^3) complexity, which can be extremely inefficient for larger `iterations` values.

--------------------
test-project/models.py:1
Comment: Password is stored in plain text. Sensitive data like passwords should be hashed using a strong, one-way hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, scrypt).
--------------------
test-project/models.py:1
Comment: Product price is stored as a float. Consider using `Decimal` for financial calculations to avoid floating-point precision issues.
--------------------
test-project/models.py:1
Comment: The `calculate_total` method iterates `self.quantity` times to sum the price. This can be inefficient for large quantities. A simple multiplication `self.total = price * self.quantity` would be more performant.

test-project/system_manager.py:1
Comment: The `SystemManager` class violates the Single Responsibility Principle by handling user management, database operations, UI logic, file I/O, business logic, payment processing, reporting, and backups. This leads to a God Object.
--------------------
test-project/system_manager.py:1
Comment: The `__init__` method initializes `self.users` and `self.ui_state` but `self.db_connection` is initialized to `None` and never explicitly connected or managed within the class methods. This can lead to unmanaged database connections.
--------------------
test-project/system_manager.py:1
Comment: The `connect_db` method is a placeholder and does not implement any database connection logic. This violates the principle of not having empty methods that are expected to perform an action.
--------------------
test-project/system_manager.py:1
Comment: The `query_data` method is a placeholder and does not implement any database query logic. This violates the principle of not having empty methods that are expected to perform an action.
--------------------

Comment: The `render_page` method is a placeholder and does not implement any UI rendering logic. This violates the principle of not having empty methods that are expected to perform an action.
--------------------
test-project/system_manager.py:1
Comment: The `handle_click` method is a placeholder and does not implement any event handling logic. This violates the principle of not having empty methods that are expected to perform an action.
--------------------
test-project/system_manager.py:1
Comment: The `save_log` method directly opens and writes to a file without proper error handling or resource management (e.g., using `with open(...)`).
--------------------
test-project/system_manager.py:1
Comment: The `calculate_metrics` method is a placeholder and does not implement any calculation logic. This violates the principle of not having empty methods that are expected to perform an action.
--------------------

Comment: The `send_email` method is a placeholder and does not implement any email sending logic. This violates the principle of not having empty methods that are expected to perform an action.
--------------------
test-project/system_manager.py:1
Comment: The `process_payment` method is a placeholder and does not implement any payment processing logic. This violates the principle of not having empty methods that are expected to perform an action.
--------------------
test-project/system_manager.py:1
Comment: The `generate_report` method is a placeholder and does not implement any report generation logic. This violates the principle of not having empty methods that are expected to perform an action.
--------------------
test-project/system_manager.py:1
Comment: The `backup_database` method is a placeholder and does not implement any database backup logic. This violates the principle of not having empty methods that are expected to perform an action.
--------------------
test-project/utils.py:1
Comment: Use of `eval()` with data read from a file. If the configuration file is not properly secured, this can lead to arbitrary code execution.

test-project/utils.py:1
Comment: Use of `os.popen()` to execute commands from user input. This is a significant security vulnerability that allows arbitrary command execution.
--------------------

--------------------
test-project/api.py:1
Comment: This review identified several critical and high-severity issues, primarily related to security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, arbitrary code execution via `eval()` and `pickle.loads()`, and the widespread use of hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens). Performance concerns were noted regarding inefficient algorithms and intentional delays. Architectural issues like the
